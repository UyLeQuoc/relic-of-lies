## Next Steps
1. Complete Sui wallet integration
2. Implement smart contracts
   - Complete game contract implementation
   - Implement staking functionality
   - Build commit-reveal system
3. Implement database schema for games and players
4. Continue UI development with Shadcn UI
5. Develop GraphQL API for game management
6. Configure VPS deployment
7. Set up Docker Compose orchestration
8. Configure production environment
9. Design Colyseus real-time server
10. Implement contract testing framework

## Active Decisions
- Using monorepo structure for better code sharing
- Implementing GraphQL-first approach
- Using Prisma for database operations
- Following TypeScript strict mode
- Using Shadcn UI for consistent design
- Implementing GraphQL Code Generator
- Using Sui blockchain for game logic and staking
- Using WalletKit for wallet integration
- Using Move language for smart contracts
- Following modular contract design
- Using Colyseus for real-time game server

## Current Considerations
